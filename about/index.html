              <h3>About Me</h3><p>My name is David Petersen. I was born in Israel, spent my younger years in Lincoln, Nebraska, and finally landed in Corvallis, Oregon. Currently I am living in Seattle, Washington. I believe I have been heavily influenced by the physical environment around me, particularly during my formative years in Oregon. Growing up in Nebraska I was accustomed to harsh seasons and uniform landscapes. After moving to Oregon I began to discover mountains, rivers, beaches and forests. I believe my creative goal is to strive to match the perfection I see in nature.</p>
<p>Web development provides a creative outlet for me. There is something very powerful about having an idea and a few minutes later being able to start to see it come to fruition. My passion is to create websites that are wholly beautiful, both on the inside and out.</p>
<p>Outside of work I enjoy playing soccer, cooking, and riding my bicycle. This website will serve as my portfolio and an outlet for my thoughts.</p>
