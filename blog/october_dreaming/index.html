<p>Its been almost an entire year since my last "dreaming" blog post. I
thought it might be a good moment now to revisit some of my ideas from
last year as well as write down some new ones.</p>

<h2>New Ideas</h2>

<h3>Notetaking software</h3>

<p>This idea has manifested Notepanda a minimalist note taking application
that uses Dropbox to persist the notes you take. The idea is still raw,
but this is mostly a solved problem with Evernote leading the way.</p>

<h3>Lunch Picking Software</h3>

<p>I want to build something similar that you can share with co-workers
showing a list of places to go and co-workers can drag themselves on to
the choices so you can see where people that want to go with lunch for
others are going. This could probably be done in an afternoon.</p>

<h3>Simple Social Network</h3>

<p>See the fewest amount of lines of code required to make a social
network API. Then see if it is possible to make a small minimalist
frontend application to consume the API.</p>

<h2>Old Ideas</h2>

<p>I am going to revist some of my ideas from last year. Some of them
worked out and some of them didn't work out hardly at all.</p>

<h3>Irc Client</h3>

<p>This idea manifested itself into Subway the under maintained high
potential project under my guidance. Status: In Progress</p>

<h3>Addictive language learning</h3>

<p>The idea last year was to gamify language learning. At this point I feel
like <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> does a good job of
that. Status: Done</p>

<h3>Card encryption</h3>

<p>I wanted to make a one off project that would encrypt small messages
into a certain card order. Status: Pending</p>

<h3>Better playlist creation and sharing</h3>

<p>I made a quick page in the playground to look at creating playlists from
the music you and your friends post on your facebook wall. Status:
Pending</p>

<h3>Automation on steroids</h3>

<p>Thankfully there are several cool startups taking this on. Both IFTTT
and Zapier are both of to a great start. It would be neat to see them
increase the amount of complexity so you could funnel data and actions
through a few filters. Status: Done</p>
