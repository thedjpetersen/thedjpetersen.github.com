<p>Its been almost an entire year since my last "dreaming" blog post. I
thought it might be a good moment now to revisit some of my ideas from
last year as well as write down some new ones.</p>

<h2>New Ideas</h2>

<h3>Notetaking software</h3>

<p>This idea has manifested Notepanda a minimalist note taking application
that uses Dropbox to persist the notes you take. The idea is still raw,
but this is mostly a solved problem with Evernote leading the way.</p>

<h3>Lunch Picking Software</h3>

<p>I want to build a simple webpage similar in layout to google+, but
instead of groups you have restuarants you can drag yourself to each day
showing where you want to eat. This could probably be done in an afternoon.</p>

<h3>Simple Social Network</h3>

<p>See the fewest amount of lines of code required to make a social
network API. Then see if it is possible to make a small minimalist
frontend application to consume the API.</p>

<h2>Old Ideas</h2>

<p>I am going to revisit some of my ideas from last year. Some of them
worked out and some of them didn't work out hardly at all.</p>

<h3>Irc Client</h3>

<p>This idea manifested itself into Subway the under maintained high
potential project under my guidance. Status: In Progress</p>

<h3>Addictive language learning</h3>

<p>The idea last year was to gamify language learning. At this point I feel
like <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> does a good job of
that. Status: Done</p>

<h3>Card encryption</h3>

<p>I wanted to make a one off project that would encrypt small messages
into a certain card order. Status: Pending</p>

<h3>Better playlist creation and sharing</h3>

<p>I made a quick page in the playground to look at creating playlists from
the music you and your friends post on your facebook wall. Status:
Pending</p>

<h3>Automation on steroids</h3>

<p>Thankfully there are several cool startups taking this on. Both IFTTT
and Zapier are both of to a great start. It would be neat to see them
increase the amount of complexity so you could funnel data and actions
through a few filters. Status: Done</p>
