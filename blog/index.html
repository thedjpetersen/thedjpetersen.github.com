    <p>I recently have become interested in the new project spear headed by
Paul Irish and Addy Osmani called Yeoman. Essentially a static website
generator it has a large amount of neat built in tools such as Grunt and Bower. For my own neads it
was missing two things, layout/partial support and a easy way to include
a directory of scripts in your markup.

    <p>Its been almost an entire year since my last "dreaming" blog post. I
thought it might be a good moment now to revisit some of my ideas from
last year as well as write down some new ones.

    <p>I have started a little open source note taking project called
NotePanda. You can check it out here. If you
have any ideas how to improve the design or implementation please feel
free to open a issue or shoot me a patch on the Github page. Until
then happy note taking!

    <p>I am happy to announce that I will be joining Amazon. I will be doing
web development on User Management tools within AWS. I don't know much
more than that at the moment. Incredibily excited to join the team. I
have really enjoyed my last 9 months have gotten to work with a very
talented team at Emberex. I wish everyone the best there.</p>

    <p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

For those working on large projects it becomes evident why Dr. Knuth
considered premature optimization the root of all evil. What usually
starts out as a fairly simple discussion on how to improve performance
can go down a rabbit hole until instead of workin...</p>

    <p>I thought I would write down some of the ideas that have been bouncing around my head.

Irc Client

A client that connects to a "client server" which has been idling in channels for you and collecting logs. The clients interface would be as a web page. I was inspired by seeing the Grove.io project. I thought that it would be possible to have a really clean web frontend that connects to a backend that you are running on your computer.</p>

    <p>I have been working the last two month on Subway an IRC web client. During this time I have discovered some of the other options that exist. I thought I would go ahead and share them with you.

    </div>
    <p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.

Why static website generator?

Using a static website generator is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.

    <p>Ridezap is getting open sourced! After 3 hard months of work I decided that this project should be public. Why? This is a great project, but it didn't gain any real momentum after I released it. I think there is a serious need for ridesharing in the US, this becoming increasingly evident to me after my trip in Europe and the large amount of ridesharing options there.

    <p>This year I was fortunate enough to be able to attend Startup School. It was my first opportunity and I was excited to go after seeing some of the reaction of people who had gone before and posted their experience on Hacker News. So after flying down from Oregon, staying with the Cloudkick, I ended up arranging a ride to Stanford using the excellent tool provided by Ridejoy.
