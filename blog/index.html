  <p>Here is where I will leave my thoughts and ideas as they gather.
  Mostly I like to talk about programming, but whatever I am thinking about I will probably drop a line or two.</p>

    </div>
    <p>On my most recent project I have been extremely focused on creating a web application
that is ultra performant. This has led to some delays as I develop slower to
ensure that the application is fast. During this process I have come to
the realization that I am losing a certain amount of time focusing on
premature optimization.

I have come to the following conclusion find a framework that forces
you into writing performant code.</p>

    <p>I thought I would write down some of the ideas that have been bouncing around my head.

Irc Client

A client that connects to a "client server" which has been idling in channels for you and collecting logs. The clients interface would be as a web page. I was inspired by seeing the Grove.io project. I thought that it would be possible to have a really clean web frontend that connects to a backend that you are running on your computer.</p>

      <span>July 11, 2012</span>
    </div>
    <p>Ridezap is getting open sourced! After 3 hard months of work I decided that this project should be public. Why? This is a great project, but it didn't gain any real momentum after I released it. I think there is a serious need for ridesharing in the US, this becoming increasingly evident to me after my trip in Europe and the large amount of ridesharing options there.

Ridesharing is an im...</p>

    <p>This year I was fortunate enough to be able to attend Startup School. It was my first opportunity and I was excited to go after seeing some of the reaction of people who had gone before and posted their experience on Hacker News. So after flying down from Oregon, staying with the Cloudkick, I ended up arranging a ride to Stanford using the excellent tool provided by Ridejoy.

The ride down was interesting, ...</p>

    <p>I have been working the last two month on Subway an IRC web client. During this time I have discovered some of the other options that exist. I thought I would go ahead and share them with you.

      <span>January 09, 2012</span>
    </div>
    <p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.

Why static website generator?

Using a static website generator is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.
